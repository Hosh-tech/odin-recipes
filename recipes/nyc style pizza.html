    <h2>An alternate take on an American Classic.</h2>
    <br />
    <p>
      Very much in the <i>style</i>of a NYC pizza, as my oven is too small to
      accomodate a 20+ inch pizza, but it is as close as I can get at the
      moment.
    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>640g bread flour, plus more for dusting.</li>
      <li>15g granulated sugar</li>
      <li>10g fine sea salt</li>
      <li>10g yeast</li>
      <li>415g lukewarm water</li>
      <li>45ml extra-virgin olive oil</li>
      <li>
        Pizza sauce, I like Mutti Pizza Sauce, but many others are available,
        alternatively you can make your own.
      </li>
      <br />
      <h3>Method</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Combine flour, sugar, salt, and yeast in bowl of food processor. Pulse
          3 to 4 times to incorporate. Add water and olive oil. Run food
          processor until mixture forms ball that rides around the bowl above
          the blade, about 15 seconds. Continue processing 15 seconds longer.
        </li>
        <li>
          Transfer dough ball to lightly floured surface and knead once or twice
          by hand until smooth ball is formed. It should pass the windowpane
          test. Divide dough into three even portions and place each in a
          covered quart-sized deli container or in a zipper-lock freezer bag.
          Place in refrigerator and allow to rise at least 1 day, and up to 5.
        </li>
        <li>
          At least two hours before baking, remove dough from refrigerator and
          shape into balls by gathering dough towards bottom and pinching shut.
          Flour well and place each dough ball in a separate medium mixing bowl.
          Cover tightly with plastic wrap and allow to rise at warm room
          temperature until roughly doubled in volume.
        </li>
        <li>
          One hour before baking, adjust oven rack with pizza stone to middle
          position and preheat oven to 260Â°C. Turn single dough ball out
          onto lightly floured surface. Gently press out dough into rough 8-inch
          circle, leaving outer inch higher than the rest. Gently stretch dough
          by draping over knuckles to form a 12- to 14-inch circle about
          1/4-inch thick. Transfer to pizza peel.
        </li>
        <li>
          Spread approximately 2/3 cup sauce evenly over surface of crust,
          leaving 1/2- to 1-inch border along edge. Evenly spread 1/3 of cheese
          over sauce. Slide pizza onto baking stone and bake until cheese is
          melted with some browned spots and crust is golden brown and puffed,
          12 to 15 minutes. Transfer to cutting board, slice, and serve
          immediately. Repeat with remaining two dough balls, remaining sauce,
          and remaining cheese.
